<h2 class="section-heading">New Decade, New Development Environment</h2>

<p>
    Last decade, I've met with coding. I had chance to try technologies in a wide spectrum, including Pascal, Delphi, 8086 Assembly, Python, Java, NodeJS, Go...
    So dozens of different IDE's and text editors were installed on my machine. But now it's time to redesign development environment and make it more simple 
    and more mobile. Personally, i like working with different operating systems concurrently. Now I am using Linux at work, and MacOS at home. 
    It's hard to syncronize whole dev setup withing multiple computer. Therefore this post will become a notebook for my environment.
