<p>
    My name is Burak, from Istanbul/Turkey. I am a computer scientist, and working as R&D Engineer for a cybersecurity 
    company. Most of my time is about doing research and experiments on Machine Learning and Data Science. I like to 
    extract meaning from massive amount of data. On the other hand, I am a computer geek, i love almost all stuff that
    related to computer. It's like an addiction for me. Writing code and creating value for people excites me. So, in my
    freetimes, making contributions to open source projects.
